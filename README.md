## Idea

The model available in this repository is a character-to-character model. The model was trained to predict the next character in a sentence, for example. The use of an LSTM architecture allows the model to maintain long-term relationships between characters.


## Source code

The source is available [here](./src). Further explanation of the source code can be found in the source code itself.
